# From Developer To Senior Developer
I've been a Senior Developer for around 3 years (with a 6 month gap) and I called that a trial period.
In my new position the kid gloves are off, so no more mistakes and it's time to take in jr developers and kick out good developers.

Here I'll be discussing a few mistakes that I have made and some good techniques I have learned from them.

## Introduction

> What is a Senior Developer?

That is a question I've asked my self through out my career, and will continue to do so.

If you would have asked me that question before when I just entered the field I would have said:

> A senior developer is a person with at least 5 years of experience.

A few months later I revised the answer to:

> A senior developer is a developer that knows and understands the technology and the work they do. The developer must have enough experience to be able to predict results and account for them. Be able to make accurate time estimates and point out issue with the solution before hand.

A few mouth I became after I became a senior dev I'd said:

> A senior developer is a teacher.

I revised my previous statement to the difference between a jr developer and a developer.

## My career
My career was accelerated to the max and I never really was a jr developer, No more then 2 months, and that's because I didn't have a senior developer.
However I did have many good mentors, some where active developers others had left development behind for architecture or other careers and some where project managers.

I started working for a consulting company that worked with the solution and development of digitalization of work environments for their clients.
At the core of the solution was a piece of software that I wrote, as mentioned above a spent a few months with a senior dev. However as I show the aptitude for self management, I was left as the sole developer on the solution.
Our team was made out of me, our tech-lead and different project manager from client to client.

### Mentors vs. Senior Developers
You maybe asking what is the difference between a mentor and a teacher and a senior dev?

Mentors and senior developers are both teachers, and a senior developer can be a mentor as well.

In my point of view the senior-jr relationship should be closer, they must work on the same project and maybe even on the same tasks.
The jr dev's work should directly be analyzed by the senior dev and feedbacks and corrections given continuously.

A mentor is a bit more abstract, the tips and tricks you learn from them aren't obvious and you may have to read between the lines.
They are rarely specific.

> This is mostly due to them not being aware that you consider them a Mentor. 

For instance you don't go to your mentor and ask them "What is a good way to retrieve data from a database?" instead they might mention an issue the had with syncing a data with databases and you may ask them to tell you more, and from that you might learn few new things.

In my opinion, having a good senior developer for 6 months is worth having dozens of Mentors. 
Having the ability to say "Why did you do it that way?", Instead of spending 30 min explaining the problem to someone that has no clue about what you are working on is way more efficient. 


### My transition from dev to senior dev
As the workload increased, my manager started to recruit some jr developers to start taking over and allowing my to move on to other project. 

At this time I have around 3 years of experience, although I was extremely good at what I did and observant about everything else around me, like project management, system architectures, solution design and user experience. 
I had zero experience on how to be a senior software developer, in a sense I would have been a better project manager then a senior dev at that time.
So of course I made some mistakes!

## Becoming a senior dev

### Assessment 
The assessment of a new recruit was one of the most important, and my biggest failure. 
Although I did not have employ responsibilities my boss recruited people that I recommended. 
So when I said he feels a bit too green and doesn't seem to be following me, and what I'm asking him. That should have been a red flag!  
But at that time I thought I was so good that I could have turn anyone to a fine software developer. 
Boy I was so wrong. 

The recruit was unable to do proper research, he was unable to instantiate an object. 
Nor did he cross reference code, to see how it was written and what was used and how was it used. 
And worst of all was that he did not ask for help, even when I clearly told him to come to me as soon as he was stuck.

What I learned was to trust my guts, ask hard but relevant questions. 
This approach worked extremely well, currently I can tell how experienced someone is by asking them how they have done a work/school project and drilling in to them.

For instance one candidate told me that they had CORS issue when the deployed their code to a cloud service. 
This tells me that the dev in question have had a working back-end and good communications with front-end on a local environment at least. 
Noting, that they are mostly fresh out of school and still jr, having experience like that is a good bonus point. 
The bigger bonus was when they said, all they had to do was to configure the back-end sever to allow call from the front-end domain.  

### Assessment Diagnoses
I hate coding tests. I especially hate timed coding tests. 

I'm dyslexic, and have difficulty reading and writing. 
Does it make me a bad developer, no. Does it effect my work, absolutely not. 
The only notable effect my dyslexia have on me is that I'm slower to read and I might miss spell some variable names. 
The slow reading is not a major problem and most of my colleagues know to call me over writing an email, and the spelling I use CSpell for VSCode and every other app i use have a spell checker on it. 

In my experience a developer under time constraints is more likely to fuck something up over fixing it.

You need to ask your self, what are you trying to get out from the code test.
Are you trying to figure out how fast the recruit can code or identify problems.
To me both of the attributes are experience based, and does not tell me anything important.

However discussing the test tells me a lot more about the candidate. 
The usual code tests are too short to talk about, most of them are collections of unrelated problems which makes them hard to talk about. 

So my assessment diagnoses contains an epic with a few user stories. 
I have no time requirements and have the candidate try to make an estimate on how long completing the tasks will take. 
This format for the assignment allows me to first see how the candidate works in an agile work environment.  
And how much experience they have with there own toolbox, and how do they use the toolbox. 

The assessment has no criteria beyond the user stories, so the dev have the creative freedom to do what they like. 
This removes constraints and allows me to see what technologies they are familiar with. 
It opens for dialogs that allows me to see, how comfortable with they are with using other technologies.
What kind of research they done, why the used the tech that they did and etc... 

I like them to turn in the diagnoses before had, so that I may do a code review on it. 
I'm interested to see code simplicity vs complexity, how readable the code is, how much comments they have. 
After my first analysis, I try to find anything that I can refactor. 
That allows the discussion to open to code quality, where I can see what is important for the candidate. 

I also try to take UX in mind as well, and discuss the importance of user experience in software design.  

After the review of their code and solution, I usually have everything I need to know if the candidate has potential or not. 

As much as I hate code tests, I think my version of it gives me too much insights to ignore.

### Developer personality
One of the first lessons I learned was that people are different, and thereby they learn differently. 
So I need to change my teaching methods to fit them.

However there are few traits that I like to create and reinforce in my jr developers, and the are courage, curiosity and experimentation, self development, openness and honesty. 
These traits are important to me because in my opinion these trait differentiate between an ok developer from a great developer.

Courage, you cant have developers that are afraid of mistakes. Mistakes are what makes us, it is what allows us to improve and self develop. 
And if your jr developer is afraid, you need to ensure them as the senior developer that you will handle any issues they may cause. 
This is important because if the jr developer is afraid, they wont be able to trust you or them self's. 
And that prevents the other important attributes like curiosity and experimentation. 

Curiosity and experimentation, the development of software is a creative process and your jr developer need to use their creativity as much as possible. 
As a developer you need to able to utilize all tools at you disposal. 
Whether it's debugging, solution design or raw development, you need to able to analyze, research, hypothesize, theorize and experiment. 
So don't be afraid to experiment and make sure to ingrain these trait into your jr developer as well. 
Provide safe and flexible environments that allows for experimentation.
I personally like the micro service architecture, even if your not working in a micro service environment. 
The micro service architecture allows you to quickly plug-in & out services and interchange them with other services. 

Self development, openness and honesty, these traits are the core of any agile project.
make sure to give and receive feedback constantly. 
Communication is key to any form of success, try to create an environment of trust with you developer. 
This is one of those lessons I learned the hard way. 

> Note you don't need to setup a meeting most of the time, it's enough with direct feedback. I found out that taking a five min at the moment of incident explaining why, has a better effect then waiting even a few hours.

### The second Ideal of Work
As I was fishing this blog, I listened through the Phoenix and Unicorn Project. So I would like to add talk a bit about "The second Ideal of Work" because it is so important. 

> The five ideals of work was the core principle of the Unicorn Project By Gene Kim. 

The Second ideal is "Focus, Flow and Joy", or the way I like to remember it:

> Flow in you work with focus, and enjoy all things in life!

It oblivious when you read it.

You need to be able to focus on you work, so don't overload you workload.  
You need to be efficient in your work, so create an environment that allows you to flow through you tasks.  
You need to enjoy your work, if don't you are doing something wrong.  

As a senior developer it is your job to provide the second ideal for your developers, because you work for them not the other way around.
So make sure that they can Focus. 
Provide them with environments that allow them to flow through their work. 
Create an environment of happiness and joy, hear to them and work with them.   



## Summary
So there you have it, this is what I think a senior developer should be. 
I know for certain that there are a lot more to learn and update here, so lets call this revision 1. 
Let me know if you think I should add or remove anything, after all we are all students here.
